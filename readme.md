# Nacchi's Time Calculator

tbh, I grew tired of looking for proper options to calculate longer speedruns times. I loathe Microsoft Excel a lot. A LOT. More so when I try to calculate a time and it doesn't work. So I opened VS Code and said "let's do this". And although there are a lot of pages that can do this, this is a lot easier and it loads faster and also helps me learn things. Win/Win situation.

Yes. *This is literally a **"fine, I'll do it myself"*** project, made out of pure spite.

And yes, I don't know how to create a readme.

## Overview

### Screenshots

The calculator has working rows for time calc purposes for each, ms, ss, mm and hours. Also the split name was added in the last edition so I could trace it accordingly. I want to stress this enough, this was made only because I need to time a 4ish hour run and I want to do it properly.

When opened "add row" another row is added at the bottom. No input added is cloned when this button is pressed and calculations proceed every time you press "calculate"

If "reset to 0" is pressed every row that had had its input value modified is reset to "0". The split name is resetted to an empty value. The added rows stay there. They are removed if you reload the page.

## To-Do

Temporarily, I want to add some things, and I'll list them here.

- I want to change the functionality of the green button so I can add a "Export to (CSV)". I say CSV here as I found jquery can handle that and as this is made with HTML/Bootstrap/CSS/JS/JQuery only, and I just started learning this, I thing I may be able to do something like that in a near future.

- I want to add an slider that let's y'all select night/light mode. (That may come soon, I already know how to do that, but I don't want to break the minimal design) with an awfully placed slider.

- Add a favicon.

- I don't know if I should add to the reset to zero button the function to remove the added rows. I think I'll leave it in this current status.

I think that's it.

My github is this one, hi (?). I seriously need to finish my readme (i'm working on it, i swear). The calculator is live on: [Nacchi's Time Calculator](https://novafugaz.github.io/timecalc/) and I'm open to questions in here, my [twitter](https://twitter.com/ARagingStorm) and my speedrun.com account([NovaFugaz - speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/user/NovaFugaz)).
